# space-autonomy-sim-platform
A personal and public development platform to build, test, and document intelligent autonomy tools for spacecraft, space robotics, and ML — from scratch to a full simulation platform designed for humanity and droids to work together as one.

## Current Focus

> Building a basic orbital simulation in Python  
> Simulates a spacecraft using Newtonian gravity in 2D  
> Stores and plots orbital position over time

## Planned Features (MVP Roadmap)

- [ ] Time-stepped simulation loop  
- [ ] Gravity model (Earth, central force)  
- [ ] State update: position, velocity, acceleration  
- [ ] Orbital plot (2D trajectory)  
- [ ] Log results to CSV  
- [ ] Add thrust for orbital maneuvers  
- [ ] Modular controller (PID and ML-ready)
